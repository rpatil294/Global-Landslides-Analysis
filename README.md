# Global-Landslides-Analysis
Analysis of Global Landslide Data from NASA to infer trends in the triggers and effects of different types of landslides across the globe..


The World is prone to natural calamities. Some calamities like tsunami and hurricanes cause devastation on a major scale whereas some such as landslides and mudslides are often not given such importance due to their nature and low damage and fatality count. In this project, we intend to analyze global landslide data as acquired by NASA and look into the trends, patterns and how landslides have caused havoc in the last decade from 2008 to 2018. We intend to cluster the types of landslides, based on the cause, region, landslide category and look for inferences that can help us locate geographical locations which are more prone to such natural calamities and how the reporting of these landslides have evolved in the last decade.

Background:

Source: data.gov
Time Period: 2008 to 2017
Data Unit: Global Data
There are a total of 31 columns in the dataset which involves various links such as event description, link to the picture of the landslide, distance from the local administration, distance from the gazeteer, local admin population and so on, wich have mostly missing values and columns undefined such as notes, event import source, etc with more than 90% missing data on those columns with lottle to no contribution towards data modeling. Therefore, ommiting these columns in the data being used, we are selecting the columns.
With the landslide data, we want to draw relative trends among the landslides that have taken place in the last decade, perform classification and cluster analysis to derive and see how these events are related to each other. We also want to picturize and deduce the effect of the landslides over the years and if these can be predicted based on the past events
